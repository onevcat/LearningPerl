LearningPerl
============

It's a repo for Perl learning to get prepared for my future working in **Kayac(面白法人)**. All exersises in the reference book "Learning Perl (Sixth Edition)" are solved.

---

* Exersises for every chapter are contained in individual folder. A pdf file is suppiled for a simple explanation and results. The .pl source files in folders give the implement detail for the exersises.

* A combination of all pdf files is also provided in [this dropbox link](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/538ozotjdtgevmt/LearningPerl_WangWei.pdf?dl=1) or [this droplr link](http://d.pr/f/cfjF). I think it might be more convenient for you to browse them at one time.

* All source files are executable and tested under an environment of Mac OSX 10.7.4 and perl(v5.12.3). Some codes require a perl version above 5.10 and specified modules, which are declared in the beginning of .pl files('use' block).

**Welcome to fork this repo and check/correct these codes. Please request a pull or open an issue whenever you find a mistake. Thank you very much!**
