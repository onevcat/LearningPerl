LearningPerl
============

It's a repo for Perl learning to get prepared for future working in Kayac(面白法人). All exersises in the reference book "Learning Perl (Sixth Edition)" are solved 

---

Exersises for every chapter are contained in individual folder. A pdf file is suppiled for a simple explanation and the .pl source files give the detail. 

All source files are executable and tested under an environment of Mac OSX 10.7.4 and perl(v5.12.3). Some codes require a perl version above 5.10 and specified modules, which are declared in the beginning of .pl files('use' block).

Welcome to fork this repo and check/correct these codes. Please request a pull or open an issue whenever you find a mistake. Thank you very much!
